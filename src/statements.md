# Statements

## initialization statement

There are different ways to initialize a variable in different paradigms.

- `proc`

We need to specify whether a variable is mutable or not in a procedural paradigm.

Define an immutable.

```swift
let a = 1
```

Define a mutable variable.

```swift
var a = 1
```

- `func` | `def`

Everything is immutable, so we can initialize with a pythonic syntax

```swift
a = 1
```

## `if` statement

```rust
if true:
    a = 1
```

```rust
if true:
    a = 1
elif false:
    a = 2
```

```python
if true:
    a = 1
elif false:
    a = 2
else:
    b = 3
```

## `match` statement

```python
match a with
| 1 =>:
    something
| 2 =>:
    something
```

```ocaml
match a with
| 1 => something
| 2 => something
```

```ocaml
match a into
| 1 => something
| 2 => something
```
