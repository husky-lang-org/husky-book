# Introduction

Welcome to *The Husky Programming Language*, an introductory book about programming in Husky.
The Husky programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
language design; Husky challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful
technical capacity and a great developer experience, Husky gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle
traditionally associated with such control.
